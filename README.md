# path-finder
## A* shortest pathfinding algorithm (visual implementation using Pygame)


* Use left mouse button to select the start point on the grid
* Use left mouse button to then select the end point
* Now you may draw any boundaries or walls between those two points (shortest path will not be able to flow through these boundaries)
  * To delete any boundaries that have already been drawn, use the right mouse button
* Enter key is used to begin the path finding visualization

To reset the program and start from the beginning again, click the scroll button of the mouse

```The pygame library is required for this program to run (pip install pygame)```
